//Create a new index49.js file
//Define 2 variables with the names firstNumber and secondNumber
//Assign firstNumber the number 10
//Assign secondNumber the number 5
//If the first number is bigger than the second number then show the following output: Number %firstNumber% is bigger than %secondNumber%
//Now try changing the secondNumber value and see what happens when you execute the code
